To evaluate the validity and performance of our approach, we tested it in two different ways. First, we run it on a few artificial datasets, to see if it creates the color patterns as we expected. Then, we run it on the BAliBASE dataset, observe how alignment size, in both number of rows and columns, will affect the excution time, and compare it with other tools.
