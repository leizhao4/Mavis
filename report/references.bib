In this review, we describe the major features and capabilities of a selection of stand-alone and web-based applications useful when investigating the function and evolution of a gene family.

We conclude with a discussion of the challenges that these tools now face due to the flood of next generation sequence data and the increasingly complex network of bioinformatics information sources.},

@article{Penn:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment {(MSA)} is the basis for a wide range of comparative sequence analyses from molecular phylogenetics to {3D} structure prediction. Sophisticated algorithms have been developed for sequence alignment, but in practice, many errors can be expected and extensive portions of the {MSA} are unreliable. Hence, it is imperative to understand and characterize the various sources of errors in {MSAs} and to quantify site-specific alignment confidence. In this paper, we show that uncertainties in the guide tree used by progressive alignment methods are a major source of alignment uncertainty. We use this insight to develop a novel method for quantifying the robustness of each alignment column to guide tree uncertainty. We build on the widely used bootstrap method for perturbing the phylogenetic tree. Specifically, we generate a collection of trees and use each as a guide tree in the alignment algorithm, thus producing a set of {MSAs.} We next test the consistency of every column of the {MSA} obtained from the unperturbed guide tree with respect to the set of {MSAs.} We name this measure the {``GUIDe} tree based {AligNment} {ConfidencE''} {(GUIDANCE)} score. Using the Benchmark Alignment data {BASE} benchmark as well as simulation studies, we show that {GUIDANCE} scores accurately identify errors in {MSAs.} Additionally, we compare our results with the previously published {Heads-or-Tails} score and show that the {GUIDANCE} score is a better predictor of unreliably aligned regions.},

This class includes certain simulated annealing algorithms recently introduced by various authors. We show that, under mild conditions, the sequence of states generated by these algorithms converges in probability to the global minimum of the function. Unlike most previous studies where the cooling schedule is deterministic, our cooling schedule is allowed to be adaptive. We also address the issue of almost sure convergence versus convergence in probability.},
