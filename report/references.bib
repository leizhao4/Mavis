	Abstract = {Software for visualizing sequence alignments and trees are essential tools for life scientists. In this review, we describe the major features and capabilities of a selection of stand-alone and web-based applications useful when investigating the function and evolution of a gene family. These range from simple viewers, to systems that provide sophisticated editing and analysis functions. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges that these tools now face due to the flood of next generation sequence data and the increasingly complex network of bioinformatics information sources.},

	Abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Multiple} sequence alignments are an essential tool for protein structure and function prediction, phylogeny inference and other common tasks in sequence analysis. Recently developed systems have advanced the state of the art with respect to accuracy, ability to scale to thousands of proteins and flexibility in comparing proteins that do not share the same domain architecture. New multiple alignment benchmark databases include {PREFAB,} {SABMARK,} {OXBENCH} and {IRMBASE.} Although {CLUSTALW} is still the most popular alignment tool to date, recent methods offer significantly better alignment quality and, in some cases, reduced computational cost.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Penn:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment {(MSA)} is the basis for a wide range of comparative sequence analyses from molecular phylogenetics to {3D} structure prediction. Sophisticated algorithms have been developed for sequence alignment, but in practice, many errors can be expected and extensive portions of the {MSA} are unreliable. Hence, it is imperative to understand and characterize the various sources of errors in {MSAs} and to quantify site-specific alignment confidence. In this paper, we show that uncertainties in the guide tree used by progressive alignment methods are a major source of alignment uncertainty. We use this insight to develop a novel method for quantifying the robustness of each alignment column to guide tree uncertainty. We build on the widely used bootstrap method for perturbing the phylogenetic tree. Specifically, we generate a collection of trees and use each as a guide tree in the alignment algorithm, thus producing a set of {MSAs.} We next test the consistency of every column of the {MSA} obtained from the unperturbed guide tree with respect to the set of {MSAs.} We name this measure the {``GUIDe} tree based {AligNment} {ConfidencE''} {(GUIDANCE)} score. Using the Benchmark Alignment data {BASE} benchmark as well as simulation studies, we show that {GUIDANCE} scores accurately identify errors in {MSAs.} Additionally, we compare our results with the previously published {Heads-or-Tails} score and show that the {GUIDANCE} score is a better predictor of unreliably aligned regions.},
